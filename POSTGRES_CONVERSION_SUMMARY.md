# PostgreSQL Raw SQL Conversion Summary

## Overview
Successfully converted the entire banking application from Supabase query builder syntax to raw PostgreSQL queries using the postgres.js library.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Connection
- Created `/lib/postgres.ts` with postgres.js connection configuration
- Added `postgres` package (v3.4.7) to dependencies
- Configured SSL and connection pooling

### 2. API Routes Converted (13 files)
All API routes now use raw SQL queries with postgres.js:

1. **`/app/api/accounts/route.ts`**
   - Simple SELECT with WHERE and ORDER BY

2. **`/app/api/accounts/[accountId]/route.ts`**
   - Simple SELECT with dynamic route parameter

3. **`/app/api/transactions/route.ts`**
   - Complex JOINs for transaction history
   - Array parameters with ANY() operator

4. **`/app/api/transfer/route.ts`**
   - Database transaction with BEGIN/COMMIT
   - Row-level locking with FOR UPDATE
   - Multiple UPDATE operations

5. **`/app/api/bill-payment/route.ts`**
   - Transaction for bill payment processing
   - INSERT and UPDATE in single transaction

6. **`/app/api/loans/route.ts`**
   - GET: Simple SELECT
   - POST: INSERT with validation queries

7. **`/app/api/register/route.ts`**
   - Complex transaction creating customer and accounts
   - Multiple INSERTs in single transaction

8. **`/app/api/admin/customers/route.ts`**
   - CTE (WITH clause) for complex aggregations
   - Multiple JOINs and subqueries

9. **`/app/api/admin/customers/[customerId]/route.ts`**
   - Multiple queries for detailed customer view
   - Monthly data aggregation with generate_series

10. **`/app/api/admin/dashboard-stats/route.ts`**
    - Parallel queries with Promise.all()
    - Complex date-based aggregations

11. **`/app/api/admin/loan-applications/route.ts`**
    - Complex CTE with customer financial metrics
    - JSON object building with json_build_object

12. **`/app/api/admin/loans/[loanId]/route.ts`**
    - Transaction for loan approval workflow
    - Conditional logic within transaction

13. **`/app/api/admin/reports/route.ts`**
    - Five complex analytical queries
    - Window functions, CTEs, and aggregations

14. **`/app/api/advanced-analytics/route.ts`**
    - GROUP BY with HAVING clauses
    - Complex aggregations and CTEs

15. **`/app/api/customer-analytics/route.ts`**
    - Customer-specific analytics
    - JSON aggregation functions

### 3. Authentication
- Updated `/lib/auth.ts` to use postgres.js for user authentication
- Separate queries for customers and employees tables

## Key SQL Features Used

### 1. Transactions
```typescript
await sql.begin(async sql => {
  // Multiple queries in transaction
});
```

### 2. CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
```sql
WITH customer_metrics AS (
  SELECT ...
)
SELECT * FROM customer_metrics
```

### 3. Window Functions
```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY balance DESC)
```

### 4. JSON Aggregation
```sql
json_agg(DISTINCT accounts.*) AS accounts
json_build_object('key', value) AS data
```

### 5. Array Operations
```sql
WHERE account_id = ANY(${accountIds})
```

### 6. Row-Level Locking
```sql
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id = ${id} FOR UPDATE
```

## Benefits of Raw SQL

1. **Full PostgreSQL Power**: Access to all PostgreSQL features
2. **Performance**: Optimized queries with CTEs and window functions
3. **Transparency**: SQL queries are visible in the code
4. **Flexibility**: Complex queries that would be difficult with ORMs
5. **Type Safety**: postgres.js provides automatic parameterization

## Migration Notes

- All queries maintain the same API interface
- No changes required to frontend code
- Authentication flow remains unchanged
- All data validation and error handling preserved

## Security

- All queries use parameterized statements (no SQL injection risk)
- Transaction isolation for concurrent operations
- Row-level locking where needed

## Performance Optimizations

1. Used CTEs to avoid multiple round trips
2. Implemented proper indexes usage
3. Batch operations where possible
4. Connection pooling configured

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding query logging for debugging
2. Implement query performance monitoring
3. Add database migration tools
4. Consider prepared statements for frequently used queries
